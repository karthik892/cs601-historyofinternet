        <h1>The Invention of the Internet</h1>
        <p>In the early days of computing, computers were considered as nothing more than Sci-Fi props. Even the mere notion of a network that connected every computer in the world would have probably sounded alien. And yet, we now live in a world where information is literally at our fingertips and talking to someone from across the world is sometimes easier than talking with your next-door neighbor! But these innovations did not just spring up overnight, or even in the past decade. The internet was a result of several great innovations that have occurred over the past century.</p>
        <p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency was created by the Eisenhower administration to take charge of the space program which, at that point, included Computer Science research.</p>
        <p>In the early days, the telephone system used Circuit Switching, this means there is a direct connection between sender and receiver. This, however, posed a problem since it only took a single point of failure for a call to be lost. This was not a mere inconvenience but also posed national security implications for the military in the event of a soviet attack in the 1960s. The solution was to use Packet Switching! The concept was that messages would be chopped up into smaller “packets” that would traverse a grid-like network from source to destination and each node would be responsible for transmitting the packet through to the next node in the grid. By using this technique, a packet will find an alternate path to its destination when a connection between two nodes is broken or destroyed.</p>
        <p>The 1960’s was an era of great new ideas, from civil rights to the first moon landing. In the computing world, the big idea was something known as time sharing.  The idea was that a user can use a terminal that allowed you to log into a mainframe computer to query information. The problem was that each terminal could only connect to one computer, so you would need multiple terminals to communicate with multiple computers. Bob Taylor (Robert William Taylor), who worked at ARPA, had the idea to connect the computers together so that only one terminal would be required. The challenge that he faced was that each computer communicated in a different way, this initially meant for the computers to be connected to each other, each computer would need to know how to communicate with each of the other computers. The solution, in theory, was for each computer to have a mini-computer attached to it and for the mini-computers to be connected in a network. This would mean that each computer would only need to know how to communicate with its mini-computer.</p>
        <p>In 1968, funding was finally obtained to build the ARPANET, it would be based on special purpose mini-computers called Interface Message Processors and the technology of packet switching.</p>
        <p>Initially, the ARPANET was only used to transfer files between computers, but that soon changed in 1971 thanks to the invention of e-mail by Raymond Tomlinson. The @ symbol was used at the time to indicate a particular user who was sitting at a particular computer.</p>
        <p>As the network grew, we had LAN’s (Local Area Networks) to link computers within offices and WAN’s (Wide Area Networks) to link computers across buildings or a campus. The problem at the time was that each network was separate and had different communication protocols. In 1973, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn teamed up to develop a set of rules and procedures known as the TCP/IP protocol that, when followed by communication networks, would allow them to communicate with each other through gateways. The protocol was eventually adopted in 1983</p>
        <p>In 1992, congress passed a bill making the internet available to the general public. However, it was difficult to navigate and understand. This changed when Tim Berners-Lee developed the technology to link multiple concepts together, this became known as the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>In 1993, the development of the web browser, Mosaic, by Mark Andreessen, propelled the internet into a user-friendly, feature-rich future.</p>
