        <h1>Browser Wars</h1>
        <p>In 1993, two students from the University of Illinois heard of an exciting invention of the World Wide Web. At this time the internet was mainly just text and was mainly used by researchers and geeks. Mark Andreessen and his friends started working on a web browser that could do more than just display text, they envisioned an application that could handle images and even video! In the Fall of 1993, the students made Mosaic, the world’s first web browser, freely available online.</p>
        <p>When Jim Clark, a former Stanford professor first saw Mosaic, he was convinced that he had found the next great thing! Together with Mark Andreessen, they assembled a team and launched a new software company, Netscape Communications. With months of feverish coding and the looming threat of competition from Microsoft, they finally released their first web browser, Netscape Navigator.</p>
        <p>From It’s launch, it was clear that Netscape was a runaway success putting it on a direct collision course with Microsoft. Microsoft’s biggest concert stemmed from the fact that the web represented a new software platform. Over the past 2 decades Microsoft had worked hard to cement their position as the sole “gateway” to the Windows platform. They were aware that they would need to find a way to control the web platform or risk losing their position as the leading software company.</p>
        <p>With the threat of Netscape becoming so clear, Bill Gates and Microsoft started to focus their efforts of competing with and destroying their main competition, Netscape. When Netscape and Microsoft had a meeting to discuss browser technologies, each party came back with a different interpretation. Microsoft claimed it was an easy-going meeting and a friendly discussion. Netscape, however, claimed that the meeting involved Microsoft attempting to buy Netscape or threaten to destroy the company.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Netscape went public and their stock went through the roof.  This gave Mark Andreessen the confidence to repeatedly heap scorn on Microsoft, even going so far as to claim that windows was nothing more than a heap of “poorly debugged device drivers”.</p>
        <p>This only served to spur Microsoft on. With their vast reserves of resources and coding talent, Microsoft started work on their own web browser, known as Internet Explorer. Microsoft plan was to release version after version of their browser and reverse engineer and imitate all of Netscape Navigator’s features in an effort to slowly chip away at their market share. One underhanded trick that was employed was that sales teams would tell PC manufacturers that they would cancel their Windows license if they made any effort to distribute Netscape with their computers. Another trick was Microsoft’s decision to release Internet Explorer for free instead of charging for it. By Internet Explorer 4, the browser was distributed and seamlessly integrated with the Operating System. By 1997, it was clear that Microsoft had won the browser war.</p>
        <p>Netscape was eventually purchased by AOL, but the founders and original engineers of Netscape had all become rich thanks to the company’s meteoric success.</p>
        <p>In 1998, The United States Department of Justice launched an anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft. The government accused Microsoft of using it’s windows monopoly to engage in a wide variety of predatory and exclusionary business practices to prevent consumers from accessing Netscape’s products and destroy the company.</p>
        <p>The judge in charge of the case issued his final verdict and declared that Microsoft was guilty and the verdict was that the company should be broken up. An appeals court later decided the verdict was too harsh and rescinded the order to split up Microsoft. In the aftermath of the verdict, a defeated Bill Gates resigned from his position at Microsoft and focused more on philanthropic works.</p>
