            Internet is about connecting individual to information and information to people. Jay Adelson, CEO, Diggs said that people trust their peers more than any unknown computer geek. Digg and YouTube were big part of the new wave of web services. They offered solution to old school media. TV host and actor/actress usually had large expense and was biased for what will go on air, but not anymore, YouTube came and changed everything because it said, “Broadcast Yourself”.

        <p>
            Before, Media companies controlled the media distribution and production, now each individual is given a broadcast tower.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diggs on the other hand was more related news and what latest going on. This was also different from regular news channel because the news was chosen by the people not some media company.
