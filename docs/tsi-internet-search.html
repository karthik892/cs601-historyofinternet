    <h1>Internet Search</h1>
    <p>
        10 years ago, there was no way to find out if any webpages except Mosaic, Internet Explorer, there was
        no way to search the web and it was a big problem. Companies that entered the search business were big
        companies like Yahoo, even the big player couldn’t crack code of proper develop search tools for people
        to use web easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of us may be thinking the next big idea will come from Apple, Microsoft maybe some other big
        high-tech company but we had to go to one place for the next big invention, which is Stanford
        University. Two graduate students name Jerry Yang and David filo were left left alone while their
        professor was on one-year Sabbatical leave. They were goofing around with a technology which will later
        turn to be a traffic search engine Yahoo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yahoo was a great idea, but all great idea don’t make great business because it requires money and as
        most of us know that Silicon Valley is full of it. One of the successful Venture Capitalist firm is
        Sequoia Capital, its most famous partner Michael Mortiz decided to pay meet the people that created
        Yahoo. What he saw in the was upsetting for him as he describe it as “Every mom biggest nightmare”. The
        Yahoo company was ran by two people with housekeeping in place, everything was mess. Michael was
        hesitant about Yahoo after that.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2007, search company such Yahoo and google generated billions in revenue, making them the envy of
        entrepreneur everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, no one really used it for business or commerce, some even thought it was evil to do
        business online. Until, Adverting took over the web, Yahoo had figure out a way to make money but that
        will cause them discomfort because at first they were worried that this move might push away their
        customers but later realized that it was the only option to survive.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1995, Yahoo started taking banner ads with their fingers crossed, for the first time Yahoo had shown
        that there was a way to make money over the web. This was a crucial moment because web boom has begun.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1996, Yahoo faced a number of challenges as it had grown competitors breathing under their neck,
        Excited was the most noticed competitor of Yahoo because their technology was more sophisticated and
        complex in comparison to Yahoo.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this stage, Internet was exploding Yahoo, Excited, all companies were turning their search page into
        portal. All companies were drifted from the main idea was to help people search for what they are
        looking for, in other words, the search company no longer cared about search. This made the world hungry
        for better way from searching the web.

        Even though, Google was getting a traffic a lot of companies didn’t really see potential in Google and
        thought it was another search page. However, Google found its way to two investors first named David R
        Cheriton and Andy Bechtolsheim, Sergey showed the demo to Andy and David and Andy automatically was sold
        to the idea and wrote a check to google for $100,000 and at the time Google didn’t even a bank account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Google also landed on John Doer for investment and told him that this search engine will make 10 billion
        dollars in revenue which shook John and left him with no choice but to invest in the technology and he
        invested 12 million. Moreover, Micheal Mortiz also gave google 12 million. Google wanted to take all the
        information web and make searchable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bill gross brought a big breakthrough for Google. He’s runs a startup company name Idealab, and he was
        the one that crack adverting. He launched a website name “Overture” which Google copied the idea and
        launched Google Adwords. This resulted in a lawsuit between Google and Bill gross but it was settled and
        both parties were happy. As a result of the new addition to Google, became the search engine marketing
        tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Internet economy was on rise and Google was its essential player, on August 19, 2004, Google listed its
        stock with unconventional way of trading/selling on NASDAQ. This IPO was talk on the world at the time.
        Google model was “Don’t be Evil”. Later Google launched Google Maps, docs, mail, calendar, blogger,
        Picasa, Youtube. Google was now dominating the world.
