        <h1>Internet Search</h1>
        <p>In the early 1990's, there was no easy way to find what you were looking for on the web. It was like being in a giant library with no idea of how to find a specific book. Several companies like Yahoo and Excite tried to crack the code to Internet Search. But it was Google, that eventually cracked the code and became a multi-million dollar company in the process.</p>
        <p>Stanford university is a hot-bed of technological innovation. It's here that two graduate4 students, <strong>Jerry Yang</strong> and <strong>David Filo</strong>, goofing around while their proffessor was on a one year sabbatical, started working on a way to use the web to calculate fantasy basketball league scores. This manually curated list of pages organized into categories eventually became known as Yahoo!</p>
        <p>While Yahoo was a great concept, it was initially not a strong business idea. While they were able to acquire the necessary funding to develop their product. They eventually decided to place banner advertisements on their website.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Yahoo started taking banner ads with their fingers crossed, for the first time Yahoo had shown that there was a way to make money over the web. This was a crucial moment that marked the start of the dot com boom that would dominate the rest of the decade.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Yahoo faced a number of challenges, competitors were breathing down their necks. Their biggest and most noticeable competitor was Excite! because their technology was proving to be better and more sophisticated.</p>
        <p>By this stage, the Internet was exploding in popularity.  Yahoo, Excite!, were turning their search page into web portals. These companies had stopped focusing on search and were more focused with keeping users on their pages in order to make more advertising revenue. In other words, search companies had stopped caring about search!</p>
        <p>It was back at Stanford were two students <strong>Larry Page</strong> and <strong>Sergei Brin</strong> came up with the idea of ranking pages based on how often they are referenced. This proved to give a far more accurate list of search results than the existing search engines.</p>
        <p>They called their new search engine <strong>Google</strong>, which was a twist on a mathematical term.</p>
        <p>Despite the heavy traffic that Google was receiving, many investors just thought of it as another search engine. However, Google was eventually given the opportunity to demo their product to two investors, David R Cheriton and Andy Bechtolsheim, Andy was so impressed by the demo that he immediately wrote a check to Google for $100,000.</p>
        <p>The next big breakthrough for Google came from, Bill Gross, who ran a startup called IdeaLab. He launched a website named "Overture" from which Google copied the idea that eventually became AdWords. This resulted in a lawsuit between Google and Bill Gross which was eventually settled with both parties being satisfied.</p>
        <p>The idea behond AdWords was that Google would assume you were searching for a product and show you advertisements based on your search.</p>
