   <h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
    <p>
        Our best diversion is shopping and internet, would start to rule the Industry. A face of capitalism, new
        age of E-commerce, Age that changed the way business work, the way we buy and sell. A age transform by a
        technology World Wide Web.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amazon and eBay, these companies shook the business to its core, if you’re looking for the next big
        thing in tech. You have to go nowhere but a garage, a lot of startup were form or created from garage
        such as Apple. Amazon was created in a garage in Seattle by Jeff Bezos. When web came around he started
        to think how he can use this technology to sell product. He made a list after list, and books were
        always up top. In the summer of 1995, Bezos launched Amazon. On the other hand, in Silicon Valley
        another guy name Pierre Omidyar was thinking about web as well, he is the idealist software programmer.
        He had an interesting idea that will later become eBay.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pierre and Jeff had one thing in common, they both thought their idea as business not just goofing
        around. Jeff had a proper plan with strategies for Amazon as compare to Pierre. Pierre just thought of
        online auction site would be cool and he could manage it from his home by tapping away. He made program
        by himself where you create an item, list an item, and you can bid on a item.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amazon and eBay immediately started making money. In the first 30 days of Amazon shifted book across 45
        countries and all 50 states. Jeff thought it will be a slow process and he was totally wrong about
        because people adapted to Amazon extremely fast. It only took few years for 50 million people adapted
        this technology as compare to other technology that took 10 or more years to gather 50 million users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Internet gather momentum as it goes, the number of user increase the use of the network increased. Wall
        street didn’t have any clue of technology but saw the money in it. The sudden boom was evitable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Internet was always unknown but launched their IPO then later Netscape launched their IPO, after that
        Search engines companies like Yahoo, Excited, Google also launched their IPO. Moreover, it was time for
        Jeff Bezos to enter the market to create the perfect bubble hood. as competition threat that need to be
        put down.
    </p>
    <p>
        May 1997, Amazon launched their first IPO, company was only 2 years old. According to Henry Blodget,
        former Wall Street Analyst, thought that Amazon business model was not good but he considered when a lot
        people talking about Amazon which led him to change his mind but deep down he knew this could be
        controversial.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jeff Bezos would lower his prices after growing a little, so he can cash in more customers, He believed
        that profit should be sacrifice in beginning to build empire for future. Jeff’s motto was “GET BIG
        FAST”. Amazon advanced when they found Public key cryptography which would solve their problem of keep
        privacy data client private
    </p>
    <p>
        eBay was into collectibles and worth about 2 billion dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Henry Blodget, even though Amazon is showing loss, it would make money the following year
        but his prediction were wrong. Amazon stocks doubled in matter of weeks, which led Henry to believe that
        this is even a bigger bubble.
    </p>
    <p>
        From now onwards, everyone was investing in Dotcoms, thinking it will make them money, looking at Amazon
        and eBay growth it inspire many entrepreneurs to move to Silicon Valley and get started working.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Day-traders made Wall street look like Casino because they are buying share and selling them at the
        end of the for more profit. 90s began the E-decade. Many companies spending handsomely on ads for
        Superbowl and the average cost for adverting was 2.2 million. Fred Wilson, Venture Capitalist, believe
        that they were playing with fire. Some Venture Capitalist thought the E-commerce came with a expiry date
        and only the big player will survive. Henry knew that the bubble was about to pop but he was still
        recommending people to buy the stock and he used to put his thoughts on private email, which later
        resulted in him leaving Wall Street.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1999, Ellen GreenSpan a federal banker decided to increase the federal interest rate which led the
        bubble to pop and it was Ellen intention to do so. NASDAQ fell 25%, wall street thought at the holiday
        time the E-commerce business would boom but it didn’t happen, and they were disappointed. Wall Street
        now doubted the statement “GET BIG FAST”.
    </p>
    <p>
        Internet Black Friday resulted from the disappointments in E-commerce. NASDAQ felt 35% points and its
        index had fallen 25%, 18 months later Sept 11, 2001 happened. As a result, NASDAQ500 has lost 2/3 of its
        value. Customer were very upset because they were losing money and wanted to blame Wall Street. Martha
        Stewart and Henry Blodget were committed with civil security fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
        5 years later, after the bubble popped, people started to settle in and now web economy was left with
        two main players Amazon and eBay.
