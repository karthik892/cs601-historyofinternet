        <h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
        <p>Shopping s our best past-time and the rise of E-commerce has changed the way we do business in the era of the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>It is said that the best place to find the next best thing in Tech is to look in a garage. This is quite true, a lot of startups like Apple started out in a garage!</p>
        <p><strong>Amazon</strong> was created in a garage in Seattle by Jeff Bezos. When the web became popular, he started thinking about how it could be used to sell products. He made a list of the most popular products and Books were at the top of the list. He eventually launched Amazon as an online book store in 1995.</p>
        <p>At the same time, another entrepreneur, Pierre Omidyar, was thinking about the web as well, he had an interesting idea that became known as eBay.</p>
        <p>Amazon and eBay immediately started making money! In the first 30 days, Amazon shipped books across 45 countries and all 50 states. Jeff assumed adoption would be slow, but he was proven wrong as people started shopping on Amazon faster than he had expected. It only took a few years for 50 million people to adopt this technology as compare to other technology that took 10 or more years to gather 50 million users.</p>
        <p>As the interenet gathered momentum, Wall Street saw the financial potential ... the Dot Com Boom was now in full swing!</p>
        <p>Internet companies started launching their IPO's on the stock market. Netscape, Yahoo, Excite and even Google!</p>
        <p>The business model that Jeff Bezos used was simply called "Git rich quick". This was a technique that involved rapid growth. This was done by lowering prices to reach more customers. Basically sacrificing short-term profits for long-term growth.</p>
        <p>A major development in eCommerce was the use of public key cryptography. It was a technique that would allow only the seller/merchant to view a piece of information once it has been encrypted by the client's web browser.</p>
        <p>In 1999, Ellen Greenspan,  chairman of the federal reserve, decided to increase the federal interest rate. This finally caused the Dot Com bubble to "pop", resulting in a 25% fall on NASDAQ. Wall Street also suffered when the holiday season proved insufficient to spur a recovery in the sector. It was now clear that "get rich fast" was not working.</p>
        <p>Despite the chaos of the Dot Com bubble, two main eCommerce giants are still going strong: Amazon and eBay.</p>
