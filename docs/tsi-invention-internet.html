    <h1>Invention</h1>
    <p>
        Internet is a defining technology of our time, a historic revolution in communicate which is changing
        the world. Internet helps connect people via personal computer through Email, newgroup, chatroom etc.
        The Internet is the world largest place has shopping malls, websites etc. A few questions comes in our
        mind that how did it all started? Where it come from? Its origin started back in 1950s, when a guy name
        JCR Licklider, a psychologist had an idea in Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he wanted to allow
        people to communicate with other people via computer, he thought sharing information remotely would be
        useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back then computer seems more like a sci-fi prop such ufo etc., The first computer were large, massive
        and had no intent to communicate. They could have stayed that way, but an agency was form during cold
        war, named ARPA, Advanced Research Project Agency it was created by President Eisenhower and they were
        in charge of space program which also included computer science. United States was in the race with
        Soviets who launched Sputnik 1, which led US to focus more on the stars then computers. Later, the space
        program got their agency named NASA, as a result, ARPA started giving more attention towards comput
    </p>
    <p>
        MIT graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock started applying “Queuing Theory” to data transmission, he
        thought of two ways how he can speed up the process of queuing theory, one was demand access(Don’t need
        it until we get the need to use it) and second was “Distributed control”(not just admin was in charge).
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, another discovery was made called “Circuit Switching” which allows two computers to
        communicate to each other. Paul Baram was hired to build a non-destructive communication circuit because
        regular telecommunication circuit could get damage and cause problem between transferring data and
        files, also these circuit allow were made so they could be destroyed by the enemies. Paul chose a method
        called “Hot Potato routing” which helped stay connect even if one port is disconnected accidently. In
        order to do that, the data was chopped into small pieces. The concept of hot potato was information
        stored in packets which will finds its way to the right network and that was the key behind it. This
        packet information transferred information faster than telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1962, a theory was presented that a vital network could be build for computer but implementing the
        same idea will take 7 years. Seven years later, first man walked moon, and the same year the computer
        internet was practiced by Bob Taylor, ARPA scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
        At that time, the hot topic talks were civil rights, landing on moon but in the computer world, the next
        big thing was time sharing. In 1966, Bob Taylor always needed separate terminal to communicate with each
        other, no two computers could talk to each other but deep down he knew that all computer can linked if
        all computer were on the same network. His theory was to link one terminal to all heterogeneous
        computers through a network. He was given one million to make this technology possible by the
        government. A little did he know but he started a chain reaction that would later change the world.
        Larry Robert and Bob Taylor together made the first inter-connect between two computers in MIT linking
        laboratory in Lexington Massachusetts. Robert had done everything theoretically but needed someone to
        make it. However, no telecommunication company was interested in it. Moreover, in 1968, Larry sought
        engineer who helped build ARPA first network, which later will become INTERNET. It was based on small
        computers called IMPs(Interface Message processor) side by side packet switching was also introduced
        which help transfer files and information. They wanted to make four IMPs signal 7 UCLA, SDS 950 SRI, IBM
        360, PDP-10 Utah. Robert offered 114 companies to bid on the project, but no one was interested.
        However, a company called BBN, accepted to work on the project, BBN build IMP for ARPA net on Jan 1,
        1969.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1969, First network computer arrived at UCLA and later that year all four sites were connected. By
        April 1971, ARPA net had 18 mainframes hooked to the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        Computer needed a major breakthrough, which they call the killer app, the killer app “EMAIL” brought
        computer networking to new level. It was invented by Raymond Tomlinson, he introduced the “@” symbol and
        it stay that way for another 20 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        ARPA NET turned science fiction into a fact, this idea really did take over the world, Internet was
        built on open architecture, by 1972, twenty-five sites were online by ARPA NET. Many would ask what
        spark the increase, it was none another than ARPA NET conference launch party. Now everyone was
        connected via LAN or WLAN.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another breakthrough happen when in 1983, set of rules called TCP/IP Protocols enable to interconnect
        via gateway meaning now all computers can communicate via same rules set by Dr Vinton Cerf and Dr.Robert
        Kahn, inventors of TCP/IP.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, Congress played a big role in taking internet to a another level by taking internet from the
        hands of government and giving it to public. President Bush sign the bill as the law, which led internet
        to cross Rubicon. Even though, the internet was growing, it became harder and harder to search for
        things online. Therefore, a Physis Tim Burner Lee, in Switzerland he created a easier way. He named it
        World Wide Web. By 1992, only 50 web pages were online. But in 1993, University of Illinois, had student
        name Mark Anderson created the first browser name “Mosaic” for essence of user only.
    </p>
    <p>
        This led the Internet growth to 345,000%.
